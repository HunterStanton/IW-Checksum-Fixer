# IW Checksum Fixer
A checksum fixer for Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Savegame.svg files. Works on PC and (theoretically) Xbox One and PS4.

If you are looking for a tool for MW2 or MW3, it can be found at https://github.com/HunterStanton/MWX-Checksum-Fixer

If you are looking for a tool for Call of Duty: Ghosts, it can be found at https://github.com/HunterStanton/Ghosts-Checksum-Fixer

I have no idea about other Call of Duty games (such as Modern Warfare Remastered, Advanced Warfare, or Black Ops 1/2). Call of Duty 4 and 5 do not use checksummed saves.

## Usage
IWChecksumFixer.exe savegame.svg

After fixing, both the original and new checksums will be displayed for your reference.
